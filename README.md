# Geo Web Data Models

This project contains the [Ceramic data models](https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/datamodel/) to be used in the Geo Web.

Referred to as the "content layer" of the Geo Web, these data models contain schemas and definitions that define how content is anchored to a land parcel. This project also contains semantics and examples of how browsers can attach content, as well as a registry of which browsers support what content.
